1. Location Service : As 
   1. As the drivers continuosly update their location through the app, the database needs to support geo-spatial indexing. The index will make search faster for given radius and riders location. Quadtree supports indexing based on location and can be potential option to support range queries. Since the updates are very rapid, option like Neo4j or Postgres GIS extension would contribute to additional latency for continous updates which means some drivers might loose riders and for some riders there wont show driver's updated location when they open the app.
   2. Location DB should be able to update the geolocation for the drivers at minimum latency. Since the drivers are providing updates at regular fast intervals, geohashing would be faster way to update the indexes for the location of the drivers. Geohashing is supported by Redis out of the box and being in-memory database supports faster updates and retrieval. There also is an option on
